I have been using these small shell shortcuts lately and I like them a lot.  The
best part about them is that you don't have to use the awkwardly placed cursor
keys. I have tested them only in [rxvt][rxvt] and [xterm][xterm] on Linux so and
I am not sure if they work in all terminal emulators.

##### Get previous command
`Ctrl-p` (same as `↑`)

##### Get next command
`Ctrl-n` (same as `↓`)

##### Execute previous command again
`Ctrl+pj` (same as `↑` and `Return`)<br>
or<br>
`Ctrl+po` (same as `↑` and `Return` and `↑`)

##### Get the last argument of the previous command
`Alt+.`

##### Undo deletion of characters one by one:
`Ctrl+-`
